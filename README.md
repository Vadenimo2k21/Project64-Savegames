# Welcome to the Project64 (100%) Savegame Collection!

This will be an archive for Project64 Savegames, because there aren't anymore such websites to download legit .EEP/.SRA/etc. pp. Savegames for Project64.
That's why I've decided to make my own GitHub Repository for that!

If you wanna upload a savefile, then please make a folder for the game and a folder for your Savegame Region because I wanna have a folder structure in this repository! As expamle: **"/Super Mario 64/NTSC-U/Super Mario 64 (U).eep"**.

Don't forget, to rename your Savegame with the ROM Version on it, that would be nice for Players, who search the right version of a savegame,! As example: **"The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time (E) (v1.1).sra"**.

If you don't follow the rules, then your savegame will be deleted from there!

# Information about some Folder and Filename defenitions:

► PAL or E: Europe Version of a game
► NTSC-U or U: American Version of a game
► NTSC-J or J: Japanese Version of a game

PAL was a standard video output only in Europe, that's why PAL games are sometimes slower then the NTSC-Versions.
